# Hey! 😄

Github would have you believe I love using emojis far more than I actually do 😁 but they're a good tool to break up the monotony of long lines of text... 😴

Anyway, I'm David and it's *great* to know you've managed to find me on your journey through the internet 🏄‍♂️ - take a break, rest youself 🔥🍵 be **amazed** by the extraordinary lack of public repos I have on my profile!! 😲🎆 

(Seriously, there are lots of projects I'd **love** to show you but I can't for academic and business confidentiality reasons ☹️)

For now, you'll have to settle for the smaller personal projects I might occassionally attempt in my free time ⏲️ but if you're still intrigued, you can read about the projects I've taken part in on my shiny new website!!! (coming soon)

I'm currently studying for a BSc Hons Computer Science degree at the [University of St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), finishing summer 2024 🌞 I plan on pursuing a Masters in Applied Cyber Security at [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), after which I'm open to any and every adventure that comes my way! 

PS, I have no idea why TryHackMe thinks I'm from Israel 🤨
